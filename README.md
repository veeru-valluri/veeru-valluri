# VLSI Front-End Engineering | RTL Programming | FPGA Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm deeply interested in **VLSI Front-End Engineering**, with a core focus on **RTL (Register Transfer Level) programming** and **FPGA-based design and prototyping**.

## Areas of Interest:
- RTL design using Verilog and SystemVerilog
- Digital design principles: FSMs, datapaths, control logic
- Writing clean, modular, and synthesizable RTL code
- FPGA-based implementation and validation
- Simulation and waveform analysis (ModelSim, GTKWave)
- Synthesis, timing analysis, and place-and-route (Vivado, Quartus)
- Testbench development and basic verification techniques

## Why RTL & FPGA?
RTL design forms the foundation of digital systems, and FPGAs allow real-time hardware validation. I enjoy bridging the gap between theory and practical design, using FPGAs to bring RTL code to life.

## FPGA Focus:
- Designing and deploying logic on boards like Xilinx and Intel/Altera
- On-chip debugging with tools like ILA
- Real-time testing and performance benchmarking
- Prototyping custom IPs and embedded systems

## Goals:
- Build and share modular RTL IP cores
- Work on end-to-end FPGA projects, from spec to bitstream
- Learn advanced verification techniques and formal methods

Thanks for visiting!
